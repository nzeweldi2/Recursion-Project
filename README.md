The purpose of this instructional unit and this programming assignment is to learn to think recursively.
The project invovles using a Cons, Car, Cdr system that comes from the Lisp Programming language
to recursively sift through text input that is top level or nested with parenthesis to either check
a certain attribute or prepare the text in a new fashion.

My solutions to the assignment are in solutions.cpp
there is also my professor's grade after running it
through test cases and a pdf that explains the
instructions and what each function means in detail.
